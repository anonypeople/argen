        * &lt;p&gt;
        * Represents an Atom Publishing Protocol &lt;code&gt;control&lt;/code&gt; element.
        * &lt;/p&gt;
        * &lt;p&gt;
        * The purpose of the control extension is to provide a means for content publishers to embed various
        * publishing-operation specific control parameters within the body of the entry. For instance, the client may
        wish to
        * mark the entry as a draft, or may wish to ask the publishing server to enable or disable specific extended
        features
        * for a given entry.
        * &lt;/p&gt;
        * &lt;p&gt;
        * Per APP Draft-08:
        * &lt;/p&gt;
        *
        * &lt;pre&gt;
        * pubControl =
        * element pub:control {
        * atomCommonAttributes,
        * pubDraft?
        * &amp;amp; extensionElement
        * }
        *
        * pubDraft =
        * element pub:draft { "yes" | "no" }
        *
        * The "pub:control" element MAY appear as a child of an "atom:entry"
        * which is being created or updated via the Atom Publishing Protocol.
        * The "pub:control" element, if it does appear in an entry, MUST only
        * appear at most one time. The "pub:control" element is considered
        * foreign markup as defined in Section 6 of [RFC4287].
        *
        * The "pub:control" element and its child elements MAY be included in
        * Atom Feed or Entry Documents.
        *
        * The "pub:control" element MAY contain exactly one "pub:draft" element
        * as defined here, and MAY contain zero or more extension elements as
        * outlined in Section 6 of [RFC4287]. Both clients and servers MUST
        * ignore foreign markup present in the pub:control element.
        * &lt;/pre&gt;
