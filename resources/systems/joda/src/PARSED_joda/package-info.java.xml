    <comment type="javadoc">/**
        * Code generator for Joda-Beans.
        * &lt;p&gt;
        * The main code generator class is {@code BeanCodeGen}, which is a command line tool.
        * &lt;p&gt;
        * Use of the code generator is optional with Joda-Beans, but it is the most common approach.
        * The code generator is &lt;i&gt;regenerative&lt;/i&gt;. It may be run again and again on the same
        * file without damaging any changes made in the "user" part of the file.
        * Only the "code-generated" part of the file will be altered by the generator.
