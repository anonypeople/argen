        * Base interfaces and annotations defining Joda-Beans.
        * &lt;p&gt;
        * Joda-Beans is a library that can be used to provide enhanced Java Beans.
        * These extensions provide the tools for framework writers to access bean and property
        * information in a consistent and fast manner, typically without reflection.
        * &lt;p&gt;
        * A Joda-Bean implements the {@code Bean} interface. In turn, this requires the
        * creation of a {@code MetaBean} implementation, typically an inner class.
        * Both also require the provision of implementations of {@code Property} and
        * {@code MetaProperty} to express the properties of the bean.
        * &lt;p&gt;
        * Other packages provide implementations of the interfaces and a code generator.
